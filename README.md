This game is sort of a Hello World for game programming with Love2D (a little bit more complex than "Hello World", tho)

### Love2D

LÃ–VE2D is a lovely (no pun intended) free game engine that drives you mad when searching for anything related to it (try googling 'what is love' or 'how to love').
It uses the Lua programming language, and works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X

You can get it [here](love2d.org).


### Installation

After having installed love, run
```sh
$ love folder-name
```

or, if you're inside the folder
```sh
$ love ../folder-name
```
